📚 Online Book Store – SQL Project
Relational Database Design  Query Optimization  E-Commerce Simulation
🧩 Project Overview
This SQL-based project simulates the backend of an online bookstore, managing books, customers, and orders through a structured relational database. It demonstrates how SQL can be used to design scalable schemas, maintain referential integrity, and extract actionable insights — ideal for showcasing database skills in MIS Executive or Data Analyst roles.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL)
- Relational Schema Design
- Aggregate Functions, Joins, Subqueries, CTEs
- Data Analysis & Reporting Logic

📦 Database Entities
- Books: Title, Author, Genre, Published Year, Price, Stock
- Customers: Name, Email, Phone, City, Country
- Orders: Customer ID, Book ID, Order Date, Quantity, Total Amount

🔍 Key Functionalities
- 📘 Retrieve books by genre, publication year, or price
- 🧾 Track orders by date, quantity, and customer location
- 📊 Calculate total stock, revenue, and sales per genre/author
- 🧠 Identify best-selling books and frequent customers
- 📉 Monitor inventory levels post-order fulfillment

📈 Sample Business Insights
- Top-selling genres and authors based on quantity sold
- Most expensive books in Fantasy category
- Cities with high-value customers (spending > ₹30)
- Customer loyalty: Users placing 2+ orders
- Remaining stock after fulfilling all orders

🧠 Advanced Queries Demonstrated
- Genre-wise sales aggregation
- Author-wise quantity sold
- Most frequently ordered book
- Average price by genre
- Revenue tracking and customer segmentation
- Inventory depletion logic using COALESCE and LEFT JOIN

🎓 Learnings & Skills Applied
- ✅ Normalized schema design with PK–FK relationships
- ✅ Query writing using SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY
- ✅ Business logic translation into SQL
- ✅ Data summarization for reporting and decision-making
- ✅ Real-world simulation of e-commerce operations

📌 Summary
This project showcases how SQL can power the backend of a functional online bookstore — from inventory tracking to customer analytics. It reflects strong command over relational design, query logic, and business insight generation. Ideal for internships, technical interviews, and portfolio presentation.
