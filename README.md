## 📚 Online Bookstore SQL Project
📝 Project Overview

This project simulates the backend of an online bookstore using SQL. It manages books, customers, and orders through a well-structured relational database. The goal is to demonstrate skills in database design, query optimization, and data analytics, reflecting real-world e-commerce backend operations.
This project is ideal for MIS Executives, Data Analysts, and anyone looking to showcase SQL proficiency.

##🛠️ Tools & Technologies
SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL)
Relational Schema Design
Aggregate Functions, Joins, Subqueries, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
Data Analysis, Reporting, and Query Optimization

##📦 Database Entities
Books: Each book has a title, author, genre, published year, price, and stock quantity.
Customers: Each customer has a name, email, phone number, city, and country of residence.
Orders: Orders are tracked using customer ID, book ID, order date, quantity, and total amount (calculated as quantity multiplied by book price).

##🔍 Key Functionalities
Retrieve books based on genre, publication year, or price range.
Track orders by date, quantity, and customer location.
Calculate total stock, revenue, and sales per genre or author.
Identify best-selling books and frequent customers.
Monitor inventory levels after order fulfillment.

##📈 Sample Business Insights
Identify top-selling genres and authors based on quantity sold.
Find the most expensive books in a specific genre, such as Fantasy.
Highlight cities with high-value customers (spending above a certain threshold).
Analyze customer loyalty by identifying users who have placed two or more orders.
Determine remaining stock after fulfilling all orders.

##🧠 Advanced SQL Queries Demonstrated
Aggregate sales by genre and author.
Find the most frequently ordered book.
Calculate average book price by genre.
Track revenue and segment customers based on spending.
Implement inventory depletion logic using COALESCE and LEFT JOIN.

##🎓 Learnings & Skills Applied
Designed a normalized schema with proper primary and foreign key relationships.
Wrote complex SQL queries using SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY.
Translated business logic into actionable SQL queries.
Summarized and analyzed data for business reporting and decision-making.
Simulated real-world e-commerce backend operations including inventory and customer management.

##📌 Summary
This Online Bookstore SQL project demonstrates how SQL can power the backend of a functional e-commerce system — from inventory management to customer analytics. It reflects strong command over relational design, query logic, and business insight generation, making it an ideal showcase for internships, technical interviews, or portfolio projects.
